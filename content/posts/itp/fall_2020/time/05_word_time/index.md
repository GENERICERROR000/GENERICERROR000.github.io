## Thinking

Here is the assignment for this project:

> I believe constraints make for good work, but I also feel the first two projects (the instrument, the sketches) are already reasonably constrained. So for your final project, I ask you to create the constraints yourself, as long as the project is related to Time and demonstrates creative and technical excellence.

This semester I have spent a bunch of time exploring words and (software) clocks. For my final project, I want to combine the two - and build something.

While doing research for my thesis, one of my professors recommended I look at the work of [anatol knotek](http://www.anatol.cc/anatol_en.html). I *really* like his work.

Here are a bunch of his that deal with time:
    - [*time is running out*](http://www.anatol.cc/textobjects/time_is_running_out.html)
    - [*bye* - textpicture](http://www.anatol.cc/textpictures/bye.html)
    - [*bye* - concrete poetry](http://www.anatol.cc/concrete_poetry.html)
    - [*then*](http://www.anatol.cc/concrete_poetry/then.html)
    - [*just in time* - animation](http://www.anatol.cc/textanimations.html)
    - [*just in time* - textobject](http://www.anatol.cc/textobjects/just_in_time.html)

The last two (both versions of *just in time*) instantly gave me an idea. The version of *just in time* that is a textobject, has clockwork inside of it. So the second leg of the 'm' actually ticks. I want to make a bunch of clocks that play with this idea.

## The idea

Inspired by anatol's *just in time* pieces, I will make 4 physical clocks. They will explore the language of time and the telling of time. Hopefully they will be funny too...
