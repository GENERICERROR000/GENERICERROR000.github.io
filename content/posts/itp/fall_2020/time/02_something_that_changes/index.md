## The Idea

Here is the assignment for this project:

> Humans forever have been inspired by patterns in the movement of stars, planets, the moon and sun; tides, seasons, animal migrations and the blooming of plants. Inspired by astronomical instruments, select a phenomenon important to you that varies with time. This could be natural, artificial, or a combination; it could span less than a second or more than years. Devise a system (software, hardware, or both) that reflects, records, illuminates and/or amplifies the changing of the phenomenon.

For my project, I would like to create an object that attempts to create meaning from changes in my blood sugar/glucose (bg) over time. 

I am a Type 1 Diabetic. A large portion of the therapies used for managing Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) involve tracking many metrics. These include, but are not limited to: my bg, how much insulin is active in my body (on board), my basal rate (a continues amount of insulin meant to counteract glucose released by ones liver), the ratio of carbs to insulin, and so on. All of these are things that can have their values change or their own ratios change. 

All of these changes values and metrics are meant to control or indicate my internal state as a diabetic. Are my levels in "safe" range? If they aren't, what do I have to do to change it? What symptoms can I expect in the short term vs long term? However, none of these metrics means much for what it likes to experience any of this. I can make sense of all these terms and metrics because I have now lived with them and very much experienced the real world effects of them. 

People without Type 1 Diabetes have no way of making sense of any of this. It often takes a lot of explaining to convey all the relationships between the different metrics. Only after that does the conversation shift to discussions of what it is actually like to experience. How I feel, or could feel, or expect to feel.

The object I want to make is a device that tracks some of the metrics I have mentioned, and presents them in way that tracks more to feeling than to just displaying data points. By looking at the object, I one would not be able to tell me my exact blood sugar, but they would knw if my bg was higher or lower. 

I want it to give the viewer of the object an idea of what the current set of values actually means for my experience. A way for people in my life to know my internal cycle without have to always ask me. That's really the important part. So much of the T1D experience is internal and private. The only time it emerges or becomes apparent is when things go poorly. But the reality is these values are always in flux, and that change has real consequences for me. It affects if I'm thursday, if I can read a book or need to lay down while my levels return to normal.

## Next Steps

The next step is to come up with a display/clock face for this object. What data do I feel can be displayed in another form, which together will create the feeling I am going for? I do envision the object being small enough to sit on a table. I don't know yet if it will be small like a desk clock or bigger to allow for more physical motion or something like that.

In terms of measuring this data, I do have access to a lot of this info via the medical devices I currently use. Unfortunately, I do not have a Continuos Glucose Monitor (cgm) at this time. a cgm would allow me to get real time data as it changes. I will build the object to work with real time information but I imagine for the first version of this, the real time data will be stubbed. My intention is for it to be real time.
