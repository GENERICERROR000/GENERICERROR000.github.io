## The Idea

To start, this sketch is incomplete. It is somewhere between an experiment and a journey. It is very possible by the time I finish it, it may be complete. But hey, from the relative position of when I wrote this sentence - it ain't done.

Ok, so here is the question:

> How do we - humans - talk about time and space (and everything within it)?

I am not interested in answering this question, but rather seeing what comes up when I investigate. 

A common way to investigate or talk about events (at least in the western traditions) are the *5 W's*:

- *who* 
- *what* 
- *where* 
- *why* 
- *when*

These questions are often used in cases or professions where determining facts or events is crucial. For example, journalism, scientific research, and legal cases.

Here are some sources I used to get started and introduce myself to these ids:

- [Five W's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Ws)
- [Seven Circumstances](https://sevencircumstances.com/what-does-seven-circumstances-mean/)
- [Hermagoras of Temnos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermagoras_of_Temnos)

Researching this history is where I came upon the term *elements of circumstance*, which is maybe my new favorite way to think about how we talk about all the pieces that make up an event, experience, story, and so on. It also means that there is some system of elements we have devised to talk about circumstances.

To me it seems that these questions, or elements of circumstance, actually form the constraints that we can use to understand the world in which we exist. Not to be too abstract, but at this moment it feels to me like they are the *how* of us (*how* is sometimes referred to as the 6th question that goes with the 5 W's).

## Thinking

Humans communicate, and when they do, they place there discussion in one of the elements of circumstance:

*What are you doing?*

*Where did you go?*

*When will dinner be ready?*

*Why did that chicken cross the road?*

Below are my notes and thoughts as my thinking progressed.

### 5 W's

A quick note: 

Much of my thinking in this area is influenced and/or started by *The Order Of Time*, by Carlo Rovelli. I have worked with and researched this subject matter before, but Rovelli's words are the freshest in my head. 

- 5W's
	- time is not *how* things change, just marking changes, or rather, *when* something changed
	- the when must be at a scale that is meaningful to whatever asks *when*
	- the *who* (at least 2) are the things which determine *when* and *where*
	- *where* is the relative position of the *who*
	- *what* is then...
		- context
		- sum of parts
		- relative to the *who* who is being asked
	- *why* is also a relative matter
- can a "clock" answer these things
	- we have clocks that measure *when* (time)
	- we have instruments that measure *where* (space)
	- ???
		- *what*
		- *who*
			- is this the "clock" itself?
			- it is the something in space asking and answering
		- *why*
			- this is the most abstract one
			- the "clock" is a tool that answers the rest of the W's, but is not intrinsic to the "clock" itself
			- "clocks" were built to help us answer *why*? -> no
				- to situate the why?
- answer it then degrade it
	- pull apart the relatives things until the clock can no longer answer the question it was built to

## Exploring 5W's

Often I find it helpful to create rough illustrations and/or write out my thoughts. The following is a series of those sketches.

To start, I wrote down the 5 W's and drew a picture of a person and a clock. I tried to "point" to the W's in the scene. This lead me to think about all of them as just references to each other.

Dreaming about having time for myself.

Thinking about what the use of all these time tools is actually for.

In this class, and in a couple others, the topic of beats, or ticking has come up a lot. Specifically, both the rate or pace of something, but also, the space in between those. The nothing, or the silence. Also, I considered the 5W's in a form that looks kinda like planetary movement.

Thinking about points as a way of describing events.

This is my favorite drawing of the bunch. Even if it is nonsense, I like it. It is kinda a relational map of the 5W's.

## How We Talk About Time and Space

In another class I am taking, *Reading and Writing Electronic Text*, I was asked to write code that took in some original source texts, chopped them up, and prints out a new work. I decided to use this assignment as a chance to explore the idea of how we talk about time.

Rather than retype everything I did for that assignment, I will link to that post and discuss some of the highlights here.
