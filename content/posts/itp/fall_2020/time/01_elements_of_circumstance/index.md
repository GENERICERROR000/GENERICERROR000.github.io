## The Idea

To start, this sketch is incomplete. It is somewhere between an experiment and a journey. It is very possible by the time I finish it, it may be complete. But hey, from the relative position of this sentence - it ain't done.

Ok, so here is the question:

> How do we - humans - talk about time and space (and everything within it)?

I am not interested in answering this question, but rather seeing what comes up when I investigate. 

A common way to investigate or talk about events (at least in the western traditions) are the *5 W's*:

- *who* 
- *what* 
- *where* 
- *why* 
- *when*

These questions are often used in cases or professions where determining facts or events is crucial. For example, journalism, scientific research, and legal cases.

The history of these questions...
<!--  
TODO: fill in history
	- [Five W's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Ws)
	- [Seven Circumstances](https://sevencircumstances.com/what-does-seven-circumstances-mean/)
	- [Hermagoras of Temnos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermagoras_of_Temnos)
-->

Researching this history is where I came upon the term *elements of circumstance*, which is maybe my new favorite way to think about how we talk about all the pieces that make up an event, experience, story, and so on. It also means that there is some system of elements we have devised to talk about circumstances.

To me it seems that these questions, or elements of circumstance, actually form the constraints that we can use to understand the world in which we exist. Not be too abstract, but at this moment it feels to me like they are the *how* of us.

## Thinking

Humans communicate, and when they do this, they often place there discussion in one of the elements of circumstance:

> What are you doing?

> Where did you go?

> When will dinner be ready?

> Why did that chicken cross the road?

I want to focus on these 5 W's and see what is in the. Below are notes and thoughts as I worked my way through them.

### 5 W's

A quick note: 

Much of my thinking in this area is influenced and/or started by *The Order Of Time*, by Carlo Rovelli. I have worked with and researched this subject matter before, but Rovelli's words are the freshest in my head. 

- time is not *how* things change, just marking changes, or rather, *when* something changed
- the when must be at a scale that is meaningful to whatever asks *when*
- the *who* (at least 2) are the things which determine *when* and *where*
- *where* is the relative position of the *who*
- *what* is then...
	- context
	- sum of parts
	- relative to the *who* who is being asked
- *why* is also a relative matter
