## Research

To start, I wanted to find lots of words related to time. So, I find a list on a weirdly named site: [enchantedlearning](https://www.enchantedlearning.com/wordlist/time.shtml). Here is the list I made from it:

{{< figure src="img/00.png" alt="list of time terms" caption="[ Time terms ]" >}}

Several words popped out, like "then" and "next". I looked up the part of speech and learned they were *adverbs*, specifically *conjunctive adverbs*. I then found a [list of conjuctive adverbs](https://magoosh.com/english-speaking/english-grammar/conjunctive-adverbs-list-and-definition) and a [list of adverbs related to time](https://www.ef.com/wwen/english-resources/english-grammar/adverbs-time/). Here is the list I made

{{< figure src="img/01.png" alt="list of adverbs" caption="[ Adverbs ]" >}}

## Sketches

Using the lists of the words I made, I sketched out ideas for possible clocks.

{{< figure src="img/03.png" alt="..." caption="" >}}

{{< figure src="img/04.png" alt="..." caption="" >}}

{{< figure src="img/05.png" alt="..." caption="" >}}

{{< figure src="img/06.png" alt="..." caption="" >}}

{{< figure src="img/07.png" alt="..." caption="[ The Final 4 ]" >}}

I decided on four clocks:

1. THENOW
2. NOW
3. HOUR
4. BEFORE/AFTERHAND

## Software prototypes

I took the four sketches and decided to prototype them in code so I could figure out some things before buying materials.

## Next steps

The next step is to determine materials, order, and get building.
