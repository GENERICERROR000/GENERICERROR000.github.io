## The Thinking Part

I decided for the project "Make a flashlight", I would make a flashlight. 

My first idea was to make something that would twist to turn the light on and off. I thought of one small tube in a bigger tube, both with holes in the side. When twisted, and the holes lined up, the light would turn on.

I ended up building two lights. 

The first light was to test if the twisting mechanism would work. It was made of two plastic quart containers (thank you delivery food) stacked on top of each other.

The second light was a "hiLIGHTer". It's a highlighter with an LED instead of ink.

## The Process of Building - Quart Containers

I needed to figure out how to make an LED turn on. I found this battery holder and cut the plug bit off the end. I could plug the LED into it, and then have wires free to use.

I tried holding the ends of the wires to a AA battery. No luck.

I tried a battery pack that held 2 AA batteries. Cool, I can turn a LED on.

I wanted to test the twisting mechanism with contacts. So.......





...While working I at some point I touch the batteries and realized they were warm. I quickly looked in the cup and say they that the contacts connected to the batteries where touching. I very very quickly pulled the batteries out. 

**Important lesson #1**: Don't do work with the batteries in (or any power source connected) - DUH...

**Important lesson #2**: If there is electricity present - don't let the ends touch - even if you think, "they are just AA batteries."
