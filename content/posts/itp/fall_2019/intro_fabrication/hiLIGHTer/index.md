## The Thinking Part

I decided for the project "Make a flashlight", to make a flashlight. 

My first idea was to make something that would twist to turn the light on and off. I thought of one small tube in a bigger tube, both with holes in the side. When twisted, and the holes lined up, the light would turn on.

## Proof of Anything

I needed to figure out how to make an LED turn on. I found this battery holder and cut the plug bit off the end. I could plug the LED into it, and then have wires free to use. 

[ PICK ]

I tried holding the ends of the wires to a AA battery. No luck.

I tried a battery pack that held 2 AA batteries. Cool, I can turn a LED on.

I wanted to test the twisting mechanism with contacts. So.......

LINES FOR LATER:

While working I at some point I touch the batteries and realized they were warm. I quickly looked in the cup and say they that the contacts connected to the batteries where touching. I very very quickly pulled the batteries out. 

**Important lesson #1**: Don't do work with the batteries in (or any power source connected) - DUH...

**Important lesson #2**: If there is electricity present - don't let the ends touch - even if you think, "they are just AA batteries."
