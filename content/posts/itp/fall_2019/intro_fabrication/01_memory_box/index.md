## The Thinking Part

For this assignment, I decided to make 5 *Memory Boxes*. 

What is a *Memory Box*? Something I made up. The basic idea is it is a box you put on the wall next to a space you need to remember something. An example is ones keys by the front door. The box has hooks on the bottom that things can be attached to. When something is attached, a large LED on the top of the box turns on.

## The Process of Building

#### Boxes from Wood

To start, I needed to connect my two halves of wood to make a block that was 4' long and 4" wide and tall. Using wood glue, I connected the two halves together. I held them tight with man c-clamps. I let it site for about 6-8 hours.
