## Assignment

Design and build a custom PCB:

- Must be a DIY circuit board
- Designed by you
- Any application you choose (really, anything)
- Canâ€™t be too easy (show what you learned)
- Finish your working prototypes and designs, on schedule

## The Idea

For this project, I am going to make a custom board for the [Relative Clock](https://blog.noahkernis.com/posts/itp/spring_2020/tangible_device/00-relative-clock/) I made for Tangible Devices this semester. 

One reason for this is because the current version of the clock doesn't work! The crystal on the Arduino Nano 33 IoT isn't great. So after about a day, the clock is an hour off. 

I am looking to produce a more finished version of this project. Having a PCB for this would save a lot of space in this project.


## What I Need

*Required:*

- ATtiny85
- Accelerometer
- Crystal

*I would like the board to have the following:*

- On/Off Switch
- Battery run (can last)
	- Can last a while because it's a clock
- Easy connections for:
	- Three buttons
	- Screen
