## Assignment

> We will be creating a group project, each of you making a PCB in the shape of a letter. Together, all your letters will spell a phrase. Your PCBs will have LEDs on them and a capacitive sensor, so that they can light-up and be interactive. 

## Think

I was assigned the letter "I" for this project. I wanted to find a font that had an "I" that was more than just a straight line. I went to Google fonts and looked through several.

I decide on "Astlock."
