## Assignment

Research a communications protocol of your choice and write it up what you find in a blog post. Questions to answer (at the very least):

    - How does it work?
    	- Doesn't need to be super technical but it should be detailed enough that to understand how someone could use it.
    - Who made it?
    - Why was it made?
    - What did you find interesting about it?

For the purpose of this assignment a communications protocol will be defined as a system of rules that allow two or more entities of a communications system to transmit information via any kind of variation of a physical quantity (Source: Wikipedia).

## Think

I decided for this assignment that I was going to research a communications protocol that was related to the internet. Originally I was keeping it broad, including things like Secure Shell (SSH) and File Transfer Protocol (FTP). 

*Initial Ideas:*

 - ARPANET
	- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET
 - OSI
	- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model
	- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite
- SMTP
	- (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol)
- SSH
	- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell
- FTP
	- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol
	- https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc354


After some initial research I decided that I wanted to focus on protocols that really make up the backbone of the modern internet as we have come to know it. The three that I narrowed down to were:

- [TCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol)
- [DNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System)
- [HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol)

*Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)*

I was interested in TCP for several reasons. One is that it was one of the initial protocols of the internet. Second, it establishes the connections that a lot of the modern internet runs of on top. It is an important protocol that lives in the background. 

*Domain Name System (DNS)*

DNS jumped out to me because it is a place where humans and computer can sort of communicate. The idea being, create human readable names that map to IP addresses for routing. It is an organizational protocol that also acts as a bridge between people and the infrastructure of the internet. 

*Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)*

HTTP was kind of an obvious choice. That said, it is how much of content and actual "meat" of the internet is transmitted. It sits on top of many protocols and layers in the OSI model, but is fundamental to the actual information we send over the internet. 

After lots of pacing and ruminating I decided to go with TCP. Through my work experience I have had more exposure to the inner workings of HTTP. TCP will give me a chance to play around with the implementation of the protocol and to really engage with the history of the modern internet.
