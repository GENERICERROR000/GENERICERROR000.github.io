## Problem Statement

The main problem news consumers face is deciphering whether a news website or news content is trustworthy or true. This leads to distrust in the media overall and allows those wanting to spread misinformation to easily do so. Today, their best option is to either only view a few, trusted news outlets or to educate themselves on the issue of media literacy and then hone that skill. TThis leaves consumers with limited choices for news or feeling overwhelmed trying to accurately check each news article they come across. With companies like Facebook allowing unregulated political advertising and the continued lack of regulation of the technology sector, the problem will only get worse over time.

## Prior Art

During my research I found many people addressing the issue of media literacy. Most of the work was either academic research or educational. Both often ended up producing materials, guidelines, and curriculums for helping to educate consumers about media literacy.

I did find 3 projects that aim to help consumers in the moment when they come across news content. 

1. TrustedNews
	- [TrustedNews](https://trusted-news.com/)
	- Chrome-only extension
		- May have been discontinued
	- About
		- Uses sources like Snopes and PolitiFact to "measure the truthfulness of news content"
		- When visiting a website, site is given a rating
2. Nobias
	- [Nobias](https://nobias.com/)
	- [Video Example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X6srabOqug)

3. NewsGaurd

		- "Written by journalists, not secret algorithms."


I also found another project that is in a similar space. Instead of producing resources to teach consumers or a tool to detect misinformation, this app is a game that teaches consumers how to identify false content

4. Informable - The News Literacy Project

	- [Informable][(https://apps.apple.com/us/app/informable/id1486205705)
