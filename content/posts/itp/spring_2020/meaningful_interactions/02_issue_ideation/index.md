## Problem Statement

The main problem news consumers face is deciphering whether a news website or news content is trustworthy or true. This leads to distrust in the media overall and allows those wanting to spread misinformation to easily do so. Today, their best option is to either only view a few, trusted news outlets or to educate themselves on the issue of media literacy and then hone that skill. TThis leaves consumers with limited choices for news or feeling overwhelmed trying to accurately check each news article they come across. With companies like Facebook allowing unregulated political advertising and the continued lack of regulation of the technology sector, the problem will only get worse over time.
