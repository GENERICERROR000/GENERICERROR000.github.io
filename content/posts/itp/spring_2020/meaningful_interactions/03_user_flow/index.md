## Assignment

Develop a user flow map with wireframes for your project as well as a mood board for the visual layer. The mood board can be a collage, Pinterest board or any other collection of visual references that inspire you. Use your mood board to try to capture the feeling you hope to convey to your users in your product.

## Think

For the user flow and wireframing I used Balsmaiq. 

For the mood board I used pinterest.
