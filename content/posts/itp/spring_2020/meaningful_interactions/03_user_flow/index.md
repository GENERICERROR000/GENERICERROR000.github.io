## Assignment

Develop a user flow map with wireframes for your project as well as a mood board for the visual layer. The mood board can be a collage, Pinterest board or any other collection of visual references that inspire you. Use your mood board to try to capture the feeling you hope to convey to your users in your product.

## Think

#### Who Am I Designing For

For this iteration I decided to clarify who I am building this for. I have decide to focus on people who are actively looking to improve their media literacy. They are actively looking for ways to improve their ability. The person has this goes, but is unsure how ti achieve it. Second, I am designing for a person who is comfortable using the web browser. In this case, that includes being able to install a browser extension with or without minimal instructions.

#### The Steno Notebook

For the look of the app I have decided to model it after a Steno Notebook (reporters notebook). The idea is to help the person feel as though they are the reporter/fact finder. To get them into the "questioning" mindset. Further, the point is not for the person to take extremely detailed notes and spend hours doing research. They aim is to take quick reference notes to help them come to a final conclusion.

## User FLow

For the user flow and wireframing I used Balsmaiq.
