			- "Civic online reasoning: the ability to judge the credibility of information that floods young people’s smartphones, tablets, and computers."
			- "When thousands of students respond to dozens of tasks there are endless variations. That was certainly the case in our experience. However, at each level—middle school, high school, and college—these variations paled in comparison to a stunning and dismaying consistency. Overall, young people’s ability to reason about the information on the Internet can be summed up in one word: bleak."

		- “…a solution is for all readers to read like fact checkers.”	
	- “‘You’ll isolate a claim that has something that can be objectively verified, you will seek the best primary sources in that topic. Find whether they match or refute or prove the claim being made, and then present with all limitations the data and what the data says about the claim being made,’ Mantzarlis says.”
		- Framework for professional fact-checkers
	- Mantzarlis and Zimdars agreed there are a few best practices people can use when reading articles online:
		- Pay attention to the domain and URL
		- Look at the quotes in a story
		- Look at who said them
		- Check the comments
		- Reverse image search

		- "We investigate one potential approach: having social media platform algorithms preferentially display content from news sources that users rate as trustworthy."
		- "Despite substantial partisan differences, we find that laypeople across the political spectrum rated mainstream sources as far more trustworthy than either hyperpartisan or fake news sources."

		- "The findings illustrate that the sharer (H1) greatly impacts both trust and engagement with news on social media, while the reporting source significantly affects only engagement (H2). The sharer has a much larger and more consistent impact than the source on trust and engagement (RQ1), and the sharer and the source do not interact to impact trust or engagement (RQ2). Neither topic salience nor familiarity with getting news on social media moderate the effects of either the sharer or source (RQ3)."

		- "We show that user interactions with false content rose steadily  on  both  Facebook  and  Twitter  through  the  end  of  2016. Since then, interactions have fallen sharply on Facebook while continuing to rise on Twitter."
