## Think

Body politics is a topic area I have a strong, personal relationship with. As I have discussed in previous posts (recurring theme here...) I am a Type 1 Diabetic (T1D). This means I need easy access to insulin in order to control my blood sugar. The life of a T1D in America today is one full of clashes between the needs of the body, business and policy. 

I know I generally wanted to focus on the experience of having T1D, so I started coming up with more specific topics and two constraints for each.
