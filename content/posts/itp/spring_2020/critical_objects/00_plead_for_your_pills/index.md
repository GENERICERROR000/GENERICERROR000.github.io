For this project I worked with Ben Moll. His documentation can be found [here](https://wp.nyu.edu/benjaminmoll/plead-for-pills-with-noah-kernis/)

## Assignment

> Prototype and document a Disobedient Electronic device/object.
>
>    - How does the electronics enhance or constrain the experience?
>    - Is the device connected to realtime data?
>    - Does the interaction serve any purpose?
>    - How does the form factor and attributes relate to the topic?

## Think

When Ben and I met to have our first meeting to discuss ideas, I was finishing a call with my health insurance provider. When I finished the call, Ben and I spoke for a while about health insurance and my experience with it. I am a Type 1 Diabetic and require insulin as medication. I will need it indefinitely and with out it, will most likely die. So I mentioned how it was maddening to not have direct access to something that I need to live. That I end up pleading with health insurance companies to give me insulin. 

Ben and I thought this was a good topic area to work in. We focused in on the idea of not having direct access to ones medicine. The idea that someone needs to approve your access to it. 

We came up with a pillbox that is locked, and through some interaction, the box unlocks. A person needing their daily pills will need to work to get them.

Inspired by me having to get on the phone with health insurance companies, we decid to maeik
