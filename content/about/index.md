GENERIC_ERROR is insulin dependent, a disabled cyborg, and an artist.

Their art takes many forms, including video, code, and electronics. They question the logic of computer based devices, like insulin pumps, that aim to use algorithms to automate labor, care, and decision making.

They also do other things.
